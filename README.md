# QRCodeReader
Native Android app in Kotlin for providing an easy solution to register in gastronomy due to COVID-19 rules

Not every camera app can scan QR codes or on the other hand using a browser app is not really user friendly with many steps. That's why I created this app mostly for me and my family in order to register flowy due to COVID-19 rules.
